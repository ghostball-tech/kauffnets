Kauffman net simulations

Code based on "Metabolic Stability and Epigenesis in Randomly Constructed Genetic Maps" by Stuart Kauffman, Journal of Theoretical Biology (1969).  Ideas for measuring hamming distance between trajectories with small difference in initial conditions from "Boolean Dynamics with Random Couplings" Aldana, Coppersmith, and Kadanoff (2002)
